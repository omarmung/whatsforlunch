'What's For Lunch?' Totally Official Readme File

Hi there. This was my first chrome extension. It's based heavily on this LifeHacker how-to article: 
http://lifehacker.com/5857721/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension
and uses bootstrap for styling. It's not really finished yet,
but I'll add as I go. Hope you like it.
